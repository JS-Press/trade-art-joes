# README

## 1
Clone this repo, and open the directory in two terminal tabs.

## 2
In either tab, create & seed the database by running in your terminal the command "rails db:reset"

## 3
Run "rails s" in the first tab (This will start the server), and run "npm start --prefix client" in the second. The order matters, and the second will ask you to agree to running the frontend on a separate local port than the first. Confirm by hitting 'Y'

The app should be running. Create an account and then you can start trading art!
